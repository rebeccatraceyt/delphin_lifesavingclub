<a href="https://ibb.co/k2SjcHL"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QvKLmbW/transaction-mng-ia.png" alt="transaction-mng-ia" border="0"></a>

<strong>4. <u>Skeleton</u></strong>

Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/Hx5A1pBFoMZs2BYT781Te6/Delphin "Link to Delphin Workspace") with providing a positive user experience in mind:


<strong>5. <u>Surface</u></strong>


- <strong>Colour Scheme</strong>

     - The chosen colour scheme was specifically selected to match the club colours. They are representitive of Lifesaving equipment used, such as flags and lifebuoys.

     - The red colour is specific to Lifeguarding and is used to highlight anything Lifeguarding related.

     - The Blus is an accent colour used in the club logo and beyond for colour contrast.
<div align='center'>
<a href="https://ibb.co/bP75jTv"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/mGS5rky/delphin-cp.png" alt="delphin-cp" width='400'></a>
</div>



- <strong>Typography</strong>

     - The primary font chosen is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato "Link to Lato Google Fonts page"). A humanist sans-serif typeface, Lato is semi-rounded with a structured, but friendly warmth.


     - The Secondary font (accent font) chosen is [Londrina Solid](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Londrina+Solid "Link to Londrina Solid Google Fonts page"). A newfolk typeface, with a rough, handwritten feel, for versatile screen display.



     - The secondary font is an updated version of the font used in the club's typography for logo and official letters. The font is paired well with the primary font, in order provide a minimally contrasting font combination serving as a practical and professional typeface with a hint of playfulness. This highlights the club's character for being professional, yet friendly, setting the tone for new and unfamiliar vistiors.

</div>

- <strong>Imagery</strong>

     - The imagery used was created by the developer using the application [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ "Link to Procreate") in order to create a consistency of the elements while maintaining the look and feel of the application.

     - The product imagery used digital renderings of the available orders, with a complete list of credits in a separate file, found [here]()

     2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/bake-it-til-you-make-it "Link to GitHub Repo").
     3. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
     4. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.
     5. In your local IDE open the terminal.
     6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
     7. Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY
     ```
     8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

-  **Local Deployment**

     Once a local clone is created, follow the below steps to deploy locally:
     1. Install all project requirments using the below command in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     2. Launch the project server using the below command in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     $ python3 manage.py runserver
     ```
     3. A server should be running locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. In running the server, a new SQLite3 database file (`db.sqlite3`) will be created in the root directory.
     4. Create a `.gitignore` file in the project's root directory.
     5. Create an `env.py` file in the root directory.
     6. Add `env.py` to the `.gitignore` file.
     7. Within the `env.py` file, enter the project's environment variables:
     ```
     import os

     os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", <your_secret_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", '1')
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", <your_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", <your_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", <your_key>)
     ```
     - A secret key can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)*

     - Stripe Public and Secret keys can be generated after Stripe account signup. Keys are found in 'Developers' Section, under 'API Keys'

     - Webhook key (WH) can be generated under 'Developers' section of your stripe Dashboard. Select 'Add endpoint' and enter:*

     ```
     https://<yourhosturl>/checkout/wh/
     ```

     - Select 'Receive All Events' and 'Add Endpoint' and view your 'signing secret' 


     8. Migrations will need to be made to create the local database and can be done using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     $ python3 manage.py makemigrations
     ```
     ```
     $ python3 manage.py migrate
     ```
     9. A Super User will needed to be created to gain access to the Django Admin Page and can be created using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
     10. Finally, you will need to import the fixtures folders found in the `Pages` and `Shop` apps. The `JSON` files contain all data needed to host the database and can be imported using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     $ python3 manage.py loaddata <file_name>
     ```
     - Ensure you import them in the correct order, ensuring that `ManyToMany` tables are imported last to avoid errors.
     11. Once this is complete, the project should run within your local development environment.

### 3. Heroku App Creation
The website requires back-end technology, including a server, application and database. It is because of this that the project was deployed on **Heroku**, a container-based cloud Platform as a Service. There are two ways to deploy on Heroku:

- Using the Heroku Command Line Interface
- Connect to GitHub Repository (the developer recommends this method)

Before deployment can be carried out on Heroku, the following steps must be carried out:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file to install all requirements. In the terminal window, type the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Create a `Procfile` file so that Heroku knows which file runs the app. In the terminal window, type the following command:
```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```
*Remove the blank line that may occur at the end of the Procfile to avoid any issues*


3. Push the two files to the repository:
```
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"

git add Procfile 
git commit -m "Add Procfile"

git push
```
Once these steps are completed, continue with the process:

1. Log into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku login page") or [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku sign-up page").
2. Select the `New` button on the top-right of the page, and choose `Create New App`. Give your app a unique name and set the region (in this instance: **Europe**). Then click `Create App`.
3. Navigate to the `Deploy` tab on the dashboard and select `Connect to GitHub`.
4. Search for the repository name (ensuring it is spelled correctly). Once located, click `Connect`. 
5. Navigate to the `Setting` tab on the dashboard and select `Reveal Config Vars`, entering the necessary key/values as below:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
IP | 0.0.0.0
PORT | 5000
SECRET_KEY | `<your_secret_key>`

6. Navigate back to the `Deploy` tab and scroll down to `Automatic Deploys`.
7. Ensure that the `master` branch is selected, then select `Enable Automatic Deploys`.

Heroku will receive the pushed code from the GitHub repository and host the application with the required packages set out. 

The deployed version can now be viewed by selecting `View App` in the top-right of the page.
