<strong>3. <u>Structure</u></strong>

The website's navigation was organized in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results: 

**Navigation Structure for User Management:**
![Navigation Structure for User Management]( "User Management Navigation Structure")

**Navigation Structure for Product Management:**
![Navigation Structure for Product Management]( "Product Navigation Structure")

**Navigation Structure for Transaction Management:**
![Navigation Structure for Transaction Management]( "Transaction Navigation Structure")

<strong>4. <u>Skeleton</u></strong>

Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/Hx5A1pBFoMZs2BYT781Te6/Delphin "Link to Delphin Workspace") with providing a positive user experience in mind:


**Post Mock-Up Design Changes:** </br>
While the developer relied heavily on these Wireframes in order to maintain the desired design, there are several differences between the Mockups and the final product:


<strong>5. <u>Surface</u></strong>


- <strong>Colour Scheme</strong>

     - The chosen colour scheme was specifically selected to match the club colours. They are representitive of Lifesaving equipment used, such as flags and lifebuoys.

     - The red colour is specific to Lifeguarding and is used to highlight anything Lifeguarding related.

     - The Blus is an accent colour used in the club logo and beyond for colour contrast.


- <strong>Typography</strong>

     - The primary font chosen is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato "Link to Lato Google Fonts page"). A humanist sans-serif typeface, Lato is semi-rounded with a structured, but friendly warmth.

        ![Lato Typeface Example]( "Lato Typeface Example")

     - The Secondary font (accent font) chosen is [Londrina Solid](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Londrina+Solid "Link to Londrina Solid Google Fonts page"). A newfolk typeface, with a rough, handwritten feel, for versatile screen display.

        ![Londrina Solid Typeface Example]( "Londrina Solid Typeface Example")

     - The secondary font is an updated version of the font used in the club's typography for logo and official letters. The font is paired well with the primary font, in order provide a minimally contrasting font combination serving as a practical and professional typeface with a hint of playfulness. This highlights the club's character for being professional, yet friendly, setting the tone for new and unfamiliar vistiors.

- <strong>Imagery</strong>

     - The imagery used was created by the developer using the application [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ "Link to Procreate") in order to create a consistency of the elements while maintaining the look and feel of the application.

     - The product imagery used digital renderings of the available orders, with a complete list of credits in a separate file, found [here]()

## Information Architecture
### Database
- During development, a single-database was setup using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html "Link to SQLite site") as this is included and did not require any further installation to support.
- Upon deployment, [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres "Link to Heroku Postgres site") was used, as this is an add-on service provided by Heroku.

## Testing

Testing information can be found in a separate testing [file](TESTING.md "Link to testing file")

## Deployment
To further develop this project, a clone can be made using the following steps:
### 1. Database Creation


### 2. Local Copy Creation
A Local Clone of the repository can be made in two ways:

- **Forking the Repository:**

     By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

     1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
     2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/bake-it-til-you-make-it "Link to GitHub Repo").
     3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork".
     4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

-  **Creating a Clone**

     How to run this project locally:
     1. Install the [GitPod Browser](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/ "Link to Gitpod Browser extension download") Extension for Chrome.
     2. After installation, restart the browser.
     3. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
     2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/bake-it-til-you-make-it "Link to GitHub Repo").
     5. Click the green "GitPod" button in the top right corner of the repository.
     This will trigger a new gitPod workspace to be created from the code in github where you can work locally.

     How to run this project within a local IDE, such as VSCode:

     1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
     2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/bake-it-til-you-make-it "Link to GitHub Repo").
     3. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
     4. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.
     5. In your local IDE open the terminal.
     6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
     7. Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY
     ```
     8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

     (Further reading and troubleshooting on cloning a repository from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository "Link to GitHub troubleshooting"))

Once a local clone is created, the environment variables have to be set:

1. Create a `.gitignore` file in the project's root directory.
2. In the terminal window, type `touch env.py` to create the file that will contain the environment variables. 
3. Add `env.py` to the `.gitignore` file.
4. Within the `env.py` file, enter the project's environment variables:
```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", <your_secret_key>)
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-ocous.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority" )
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", <your_mongo_db_name>)
```
For the `MONGO_URI` ensure to replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster_name>` and `<database_name>` with the appropriate alternatives.



### 3. Heroku App Creation
The website requires back-end technology, including a server, application and database. It is because of this that the project was deployed on **Heroku**, a container-based cloud Platform as a Service. There are two ways to deploy on Heroku:

- Using the Heroku Command Line Interface
- Connect to GitHub Repository (the developer recommends this method)

Before deployment can be carried out on Heroku, the following steps must be carried out:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file to install all requirements. In the terminal window, type the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Create a `Procfile` file so that Heroku knows which file runs the app. In the terminal window, type the following command:
```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```
*Remove the blank line that may occur at the end of the Procfile to avoid any issues*


3. Push the two files to the repository:
```
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"

git add Procfile 
git commit -m "Add Procfile"

git push
```
Once these steps are completed, continue with the process:

1. Log into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku login page") or [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku sign-up page").
2. Select the `New` button on the top-right of the page, and choose `Create New App`. Give your app a unique name and set the region (in this instance: **Europe**). Then click `Create App`.
3. Navigate to the `Deploy` tab on the dashboard and select `Connect to GitHub`.
4. Search for the repository name (ensuring it is spelled correctly). Once located, click `Connect`. 
5. Navigate to the `Setting` tab on the dashboard and select `Reveal Config Vars`, entering the necessary key/values as below:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
IP | 0.0.0.0
PORT | 5000
SECRET_KEY | `<your_secret_key>`
MONGO_URI | `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-ocous.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
MONGO_DBNAME | `<your_mongo_db_name>`

6. Navigate back to the `Deploy` tab and scroll down to `Automatic Deploys`.
7. Ensure that the `master` branch is selected, then select `Enable Automatic Deploys`.

Heroku will receive the pushed code from the GitHub repository and host the application with the required packages set out. 

The deployed version can now be viewed by selecting `View App` in the top-right of the page.

## Credits 
The developer consulted multiple sites in order to better understand the code they needed to implement their deisgn. 

The [Code Institute Boutique Ado Mini Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) was used as a reference point for the developer in the development of the core functionality of the website. The lessons included with the mini-project helped the developer to get a better understanding of each functionality and how to customise it to suit their project.

For code that was copied and edited, the developer made sure to reference this within the code. The following sites were used on a more regular basis:
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/ "Link to Stack Overflow page")
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/ "Link to W3Schools page")
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Link to BootStrap page")
- [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ "Link to JSfiddle page")
