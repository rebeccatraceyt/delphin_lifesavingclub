<div style="margin:auto; width:90%">
<strong>Navigation Structure for User Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/user-mng-ia.png" alt="User Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<div style="margin:auto; width:90%">
<strong>Navigation Structure for Product Management:</strong>

<div style="margin:auto; width:90%">
<strong>Navigation Structure for Transaction Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/transaction-mng-ia.png" alt="Transaction Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<strong>4. <u>Skeleton</u></strong>

Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/Hx5A1pBFoMZs2BYT781Te6/Delphin "Link to Delphin Workspace") with providing a positive user experience in mind:


<strong>5. <u>Surface</u></strong>


- <strong>Colour Scheme</strong>

     - The chosen colour scheme was specifically selected to match the club colours. They are representitive of Lifesaving equipment used, such as flags and lifebuoys.

     - The red colour is specific to Lifeguarding and is used to highlight anything Lifeguarding related.

     - The Blus is an accent colour used in the club logo and beyond for colour contrast.

<div style="margin:auto; width:90%; border:2px solid black">
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/delphin-cp.png" alt="Delphin Colour Palette" />
</div>



- <strong>Typography</strong>

     - The primary font chosen is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato "Link to Lato Google Fonts page"). A humanist sans-serif typeface, Lato is semi-rounded with a structured, but friendly warmth.


     - The Secondary font (accent font) chosen is [Londrina Solid](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Londrina+Solid "Link to Londrina Solid Google Fonts page"). A newfolk typeface, with a rough, handwritten feel, for versatile screen display.



     - The secondary font is an updated version of the font used in the club's typography for logo and official letters. The font is paired well with the primary font, in order provide a minimally contrasting font combination serving as a practical and professional typeface with a hint of playfulness. This highlights the club's character for being professional, yet friendly, setting the tone for new and unfamiliar vistiors.

<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/londrina.png" alt="Londrina Typography" />
</div>

- <strong>Imagery</strong>

     - The imagery used was created by the developer using the application [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ "Link to Procreate") in order to create a consistency of the elements while maintaining the look and feel of the application.

     - The product imagery used digital renderings and, where permitted, the developer edited them to display the Club imagery and colour scheme. A complete list of credits can be found in a separate file [here](image_credits.md).

## Information Architecture
### Database
- During development, a single-database was setup using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html "Link to SQLite site") as this is included and did not require any further installation to support.
- Upon deployment, [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres "Link to Heroku Postgres site") was used, as this is an add-on service provided by Heroku.

### Features to Implement in the future
- **SwapShop Page**
     - As children tend to grow out of their clothing quickly, a service we are looking into providing is a 'SwapShop' allowing swimmers to trade club gear (excluding swimwear) with others, passing it along to to others when they grow out of it.
     - The devloper looked into implementing this, researching how to set up a virtual noticeboard, but it proved to require a far greater skillset than their current abilities.

- **QR Codes**
     - Another feature that was looked into was providing unique QR codes with every class purchase. 
     - The club is currently looking into implementing this into their registration process, to avoid paperwork methods, and are only in the design stages. 
     - The project time constraint was the deciding factor as the devloper needed to finish the design of the scanning process and learn how to implement it in order to use it.

- **Swimmer Profiles**
     - As the club moves away from paperwork methods, integrating into a more technologically minded system (for GDPR reasons), we would want to expand this webshop into providing a 'Swimmer Profile', allowing swimmers to log in to see their progress week-by-week.
     - Although looked into, the current skillset discouraged the developer to research this feature any further as they did not think they could do it the justice the feature deserves.

## Issues and Bugs 

The developer encountered a number of issues during the development of the website, with the noteworthy ones listed below, along with solutions or ideas to implement in the future.

**Pagination** <br />
In implementing the pagination feature (allowing only 12 products to be displayed on the page at any given time), the developer encountered an issue wherby, when applying pagination on the filtered pages, **[All Apparel](https://delphin-lifesavingclub.herokuapp.com/shop/apparel?category=tshirts,jacket_hoodies,accessories,swimwear,swim_accessories "Link to All Apparel page"), [All Courses](https://delphin-lifesavingclub.herokuapp.com/shop/courses?category=swimming_jnr,swimming_snr,lifesaving,lifeguarding "Link to All Courses page") and [Search](https://delphin-lifesavingclub.herokuapp.com/shop/search "Link to Search page")**, the feature would reset the filters set (e.g. the product categories) from the second page, meaning, that instead of the refined search the user had selected, all products would be displayed. This was not practical and rendered the category filtering system useless, so the devloper had to omit the pagination on these pages. The work around was to provide category filtering buttons at the top of the page, so that the user did not have to scroll through all products, but could instead just display the sub-categories they desired.

**Users App** <br />
The original design of the User model was called the `Profile` model. This was a fatal error on the developers part as it clashed with the integrated profile authorisation from `allauth`. As a result, the developer had to revert two commits and re-create the profile app as the new `users` app to restore functionality.

**Google Maps Embed** <br />
The developers original design called for a Google Maps API to be used on the contacts page, giving users the ability to view the pool location with ease and clarity. On researching the methods of implementation, they discovered there were issues in using the API, the primary problem being authorisation when deploying on Heroku. From various sources, it was clear that additional variables were necessary in order to create a functioning map. It was decided, in order to avoid these additional steps, that an embedding of the map would be used instead. Sourced from [Google Map Generator](https://google-map-generator.com/ "Link to Google Maps Generator homepage").

**Quantity Counter** <br />
The biggest issue the developer faced was implementing the `stock_count` functionality. The feature was in the original designs, and the developer heavily researched how to create it, using `ManyToMany` relationships amongst their models. Through plenty of trial and error, and with the incredible patience of their mentor, the developer was able to achieve functionality. An issue arose in the implementation with a clash between the `stock_count` and `quantity` fields, where the user could select more than the product's current stock and put it in their bag. The developer was able to fix this by adapting a sourced solution from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30785074/set-max-value-of-input-based-on-selections-data-attribute "Link to the solution page").

     *(Further reading and troubleshooting on cloning a repository from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository "Link to GitHub troubleshooting"))*


### Local Deployment

Once a local clone is created, follow the below steps to deploy locally:
1. Install all project requirments using the below command in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```
2. Create a `.gitignore` file in the project's root directory.
3. Create an `env.py` file in the root directory.
4. Add `env.py` to the `.gitignore` file.
5. Within the `env.py` file, enter the project's environment variables:
     ```
     import os

     os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", <your_secret_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", '1')
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", <your_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", <your_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", <your_key>)
     ```
     - A secret key can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)*

     - Stripe Public and Secret keys can be generated after Stripe account signup. Keys are found in 'Developers' Section, under 'API Keys'

     - Webhook key (WH) can be generated under 'Developers' section of your stripe Dashboard. Select 'Add endpoint' and enter:*

     ```
     https://<yourhosturl>/checkout/wh/
     ```

     - Select 'Receive All Events' and 'Add Endpoint' and view your 'signing secret' 

6. Migrations will need to be made to create the local database and can be done using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py makemigrations
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py migrate
     ```
7. Next, you will need to import the fixtures folders found in the `Pages` and `Shop` apps. The `JSON` files contain all data needed to host the database and can be imported using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata swim_category
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata swim_programme
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata faq
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata category
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata product
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata product_option
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata product_select
     ```
     - Ensure you import them in the correct order (as above), ensuring that the `ManyToMany` table is imported last, to avoid errors.

8. A `superuser` will needed to be created to gain access to the Django Admin Page and can be created using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
9. Launch the project server using the below command in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py runserver
     ```
10. A server should be running locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. In running the server, a new SQLite3 database file (`db.sqlite3`) will be created in the root directory.

*Once this is complete, the project should run within your local development environment.*

### Heroku App Creation
The website requires back-end technology, including a server, application and database. It is because of this that the project was deployed on **Heroku**, a container-based cloud Platform as a Service. There are two ways to deploy on Heroku:

- Using the Heroku Command Line Interface
- Connect to GitHub Repository (the developer recommends this method)

**Create Heroku App**
1. Log into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku login page") or [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku sign-up page").
2. Select the `New` button on the top-right of the page, and choose `Create New App`. Give your app a unique name (something that is the same, or similar to, your Django App) and set the region (in this instance: **Europe**). Then click `Create App`.
3. Navigate to the `Deploy` tab on the dashboard and select `Connect to GitHub`.
4. Search for the repository name (ensuring it is spelled correctly). Once located, click `Connect`. 

**Create PostgreSQL Database**
1. On the Heroku dashboard, navigate to `Resources` section.
2. In the search bar, enter `postgres` and select `Heroku Postgres`.
3. For this project, the plan name os `Hobby Dev - Free`, but feel free to select your own.
4. Once a plan is selected, `Submit Order Form`.

**Configure Heroku Variables**
1. On the Heroku dashboard, navigate to `Settings` and locate `Reveal Config Vars` button to set the following necessary variables for the project (Note: You may not have all variable values yet, add the ones that you have available and add the others in due course):

     | Key      | Value  |
     |--------------|--------------|
     | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `Your AWS Access Key` |
     | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `Your AWS Secret Access Key` |
     | DATABASE_URL | `Your Database URL` |
     | EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `Your Email Password` |
     | EMAIL_HOST_USER | `Your Email Address`|
     | SECRET_KEY | `Your Secret Key` |
     | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `Your Stripe Public Key` |
     | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `Your Stripe Secret Key` |
     | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `Your Stripe WH Key` |
     | USE_AWS | `TRUE` |
     ***Ensure all values are the same as the values set in your `env.py` file***

2. Navigate back to the `Deploy` tab and scroll down to `Automatic Deploys`.
3. Ensure that the `master` branch is selected, then select `Enable Automatic Deploys`.

**Configure PostgreSQL Database**
1. In the project CLI, install the following dependancies to use Postgres:
     ```
     pip3 install dj_database_url
     ```
     ```
     pip3 install psycopg2_binary
     ```
     ```
     pip3 install gunicorn
     ```
2. Freeze new dependancies using `$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
3. Create a `Procfile` file so that Heroku knows which file runs the app. In the terminal window, type the following command:
     ```
     $ echo web: python app.py > Procfile
     ```
     *Remove the blank line that may occur at the end of the Procfile to avoid any issues*
4. Push the two files to the repository:
     ```
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m "Commit Message"
     $ git push
     ```
5. In the project's `settings.py` file:
     - Add `import dj_database_url` to imports section (top)
     - Locate `DATABASES` constant variable within the file and replace it with the following:
          ```
          if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
               DATABASES = {"default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ ["DATABASE_URL"])}
          else:
               DATABASES = {
               "default": {
                    "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
                    "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
               }
          }

          ```
6. Backup current SQLite database by entering the following into the CLI:
     ```
     ./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
     ```
7. Login into your Heroku CLI using: 
     ```
     heroku login -i
     ```
8. Migrate models to the new Postgres database:
     ```
     python manage.py makemigrations
     ```
     ```
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
9. A new `superuser` will needed to be created to gain access to the Django Admin Page and can be created using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
10. Reload the data into the new database using the folowing:
     ```
     ./manage.py loaddata db.json
     ```
11. Temporarily disable `COLLECTSTATIC` to prevent Heroku from collecting static files until they have been set up on AWS:
     ```
     heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <your app name>
     ```
     *`--app` command is necessary if you have more than one heroku apps*
12. Add Heroku to the `ALLOWED HOSTS` varible in `settings.py`: 
     ```
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1',
                      '<your app name>.herokuapp.com',
                      'localhost']
     ```
13. Push these changes to Github:
     ```
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m "Commit Message"
     $ git push
     ```
14. Set up push to Heroku:
     ```
     heroku git:remote -a <your app name>
     ```
15. Push to Heroku:
     ```
     git push heroku main
     ```

Heroku will receive the pushed code from the GitHub repository and host the application with the required packages set out. 

The deployed version can now be viewed by selecting `View App` in the top-right of the page.

For further information on creating a bucket, head to the [AWS Instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html "Create a bucket tutorial") page

**Configure Bucket**
1. In the project CLI, install the following dependancies to use AWS:
     ```
     pip3 install boto3
     ```
     ```
     pip3 install django-storages
     ```
2. Freeze new dependancies using `$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
3. In the project's `settings.py` file, add `storages` to INSTALLED_APPS variable.
4. In order to link your new AWS Bucket to your project, paste:
     ```
     if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
          # Cache control
          AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
               'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
               'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
          }

          # Bucket Config
          AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your_bucket_name'
          AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your_region'
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
          AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

          # Static and media files
          STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
          STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
          DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
          MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

          # Override static and media URLs in production
          STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
          MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
     ```
5. Create a `custom_storages.py` file in your project's root directory. Inside it, include the Static and Media Storage locations:
     ```
     from django.conf import settings
     from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

     class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
     location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

     class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
     location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
     ```
6. Delete `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable from your Heroku Config Variables
7. Push these changes to Github:
     ```
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m "Commit Message"
     $ git push
     ```

<div style='text-align:center'>
<h2><span style='font-size:20px;'>&#127882;</span> Congratulations! <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#127882;</span> </h2>
<h4>Your project is ready to use. Have fun!</h4>
</div>
